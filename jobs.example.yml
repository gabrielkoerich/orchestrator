# Example job:
#   - id: daily-sync
#     schedule: "0 9 * * *"         # cron expression (min hour dom month dow)
#     task:
#       title: "Daily code sync"
#       body: "Pull latest changes and run linting"
#       labels: [sync]
#       agent: ""                   # empty = let router decide
#     enabled: true
#     last_run: null
#     last_task_status: null
#     active_task_id: null
#
# Schedule shortcuts: @hourly @daily @weekly @monthly @yearly
#
# Dedup: if active_task_id points to a task that isn't "done",
# the job waits. Tasks can delegate, retry, get reviewed — the
# job won't create a duplicate until the previous run finishes.
