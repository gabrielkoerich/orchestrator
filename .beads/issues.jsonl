{"id":"orchestrator-5pu","title":"Prevent retry loops on environment/tooling failures","description":"When a task fails with 'command not found' or 'No such file or directory' for a build tool, the orchestrator should not retry automatically. These errors won't resolve without manual intervention. Implementation: 1) In run_task.sh post-processing, detect env failure patterns in agent output (command not found, No such file or directory for known tools) 2) Mark such tasks as needs_review instead of allowing auto-retry 3) Add the detected missing tool to the error message for clarity. On 2026-02-19, 14 tasks were bulk-retried at 02:21 UTC and all immediately failed with the same env issue, wasting tokens.","status":"in_review","priority":2,"issue_type":"task","assignee":"claude","owner":"gabrielmk@gmail.com","created_at":"2026-02-20T10:24:49Z","created_by":"Gabriel Koerich","updated_at":"2026-02-20T10:24:50Z","external_ref":"gh-125","labels":["complexity:medium","gh:125"]}
