## Summary

Triaged an `@orchestrator` mention on #192 that referenced prior work on #158.

**Finding:** #158 was already fully implemented and merged via PR #162 (`feat(status): show open task count`), despite the original codex run timing out mid-run.

**Action taken:** Posted a clarification comment on #192 and linked back to the results summary on #158 for future readers.
